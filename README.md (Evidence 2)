# Evidence 2 of Decision support analysis

Some interesting points that captured my attention from module 1 where:
That for decision making, mathematical modeling is fundamental since it provides a structure framework to understand, predict and optimize outcomes. For me this was really interesting since it represents a crucial role in real life situations or even systems, which consequently can offer several benefits such as: Quantitive Analysis, Optimization and Decision Support, Prediction and Forecasting. 
Talking abput predictions and forecasting, the most interesting part from module 2 for me, was the forecasting topic. I found this topic amazing since it is really helpful and its usefull in order to predict or analyze future data and situations. Forecasting mostly estimates the relationships between variables and make predictions about future outcomes. Moreover,involves time series data, where regression analysis is applied to capture temporal patterns and dependencies.
For me the most challenging thing from this course was being able to put in code the things we've learned. I did understood what we were doing but when it comes to tell the computer what to do, for me it's really hard. But fortunately I was able to understand the previous with the help of the repositories and the teacher. 
Finally I really liked this course and also found it very usefull, because I was able to connect this acquaired knowledge with my career (Global Business). Since forecasting and in general the topics seen at class play a crucial role in businesses like empowering organizations to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and plan for the future, by analyzing this historical data and identifying trends, patterns, and relationships, forecasting enables businesses to anticipate changes, mitigate risks, and capitalize on opportunities.
